# Skeleton Sticky Footer

If you're reading this, you've likely already found
[Skeleton][skeleton], the super-lightweight grid-based layout. You
have probably also found that Skeleton is so lightweight as to not
have any cross-browser support for a footer that will remain at the
bottom of the page, even if the page content is short.

This repository contains a minimally-enhanced version of the
boilerplate "Basic page" with which Skeleton 2.0.4 ships. The page
adds the necessary wrapper divs to create a sticky footer, while
leaving the rest of the basic page exactly the same. The footer is
cross-browser tested and supports Skeleton-based responsive columns
and sizing.

Special thanks to [Kyle Powers][kp] for his help. All the
modifications to the baseline Skeleton are released under [CC0][cc0].
